A simple Chrome extension which I wrote to provide shortcuts for menus which I accessed routinely as part of my job.
It's quite useful as if avoids navigating through a sea of menus in the WebSphere Administration console!

To customise your shortcuts, in the content.js file, modify the variables *commonLinks* and *portalLinks*.

Then load the extension into Chrome/Chromium.
